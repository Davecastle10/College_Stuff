# Graphs and Trees quiz
## 1. State 3 similarities between a graph and a tree?  
1. Both use nodes
2. Both use edges
3. Both are abstract data structures
4. Both are used ofr searching  
    1. Depth first (both)  
    2. Breadth first (both)
    3. In/Post/Pre - Order (Tree?)

## 2. State 2 differneces between a graph and a tree?
1. Graphs can have cycles
2. Graphs often have directed edges
3. Trees have a root node that is at the top of it's internal hierarchy
4. Trees can have subtrees - they are recursive in nature
5. Tree hierarchy  
    1. root 
    2. child
    3. thr root is the highest node

## 3. Breadth first search on a graph

5 4 2 6 1 3 7 

## 4. How many edges would there be in a fully connected graph with 10 vertices?

sum of 1 to (no. vertices - 1)   

 answer = 45
