# Notes on Trees

## Basic explanation 

Trees are a data structure based on graphs, the key differences are that:   

- Trees always extend down from one root node. 
- Trees cannot have cycles. 
- The node above a node in the Hierarchy is called the parent node, and the nodes below that bode are called it's children.
- Nodes without children are called leaf nodes.
