## The legality of the InterMovie streaming service.

InterMovie is a streaming service that enables users to stream movies over the internet. The service stores played movies in a cache on the user's computer. This approach allows future users to stream the movie from other users' computers, reducing the need for streaming directly from the company's servers. While this model has benefits, it raises legal issues, including compliance with laws such as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), the Investigatory Powers Act 2016(IPA the newer expanded version of RIPA), the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988(CPDA), the Data Protection Regulations(DPR the UK version of GDPR), the Digital Millennium Copyright Act(DMCA), the terrorism act 2006, and the Digital Rights Management(DMR).
To set up this service, InterMovie would have considered compliance with laws related to copyright, data protection, and user privacy. The service needs to ensure it has the rights to stream movies to its users and comply with regulations related to data protection and privacy.  

Regarding copyright law, the company must ensure that it has the necessary licenses to stream movies to its users, or that the content it stream is protected from copyright laws by means of the work counting as a parody or commentary of the original media. If not, the company risks facing legal action from copyright holders. Additionally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requires InterMovie to remove copyrighted content upon receiving a valid takedown notice from a copyright holder. The company must have procedures in place to handle these requests promptly.  

Data protection regulations require companies to handle users' data with care. InterMovie must obtain users' consent to store movies on their devices and ensure that data transfer is secure. The company must also have measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to users' data, especially if the data is of a very private nature such as: payment methods, address, emails and passwords. The GDPR and its successor the DPR require that companies hold user data no longer than is required for the purpose it was collected, additionally the UK Government suggests that some data such as financial records and employee data – after the end of employment - be kept for up to 6 years. This data collection means that InterMovie should have a strict data retention policy to follow to ensure that it does not violate any data protection laws when storing and processing this data, and failure to comply with data protection laws could end with InterMovie being on the receiving end of serious legal ramifications.  

The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 requires service providers to assist with lawful interception and interference requests of digital communications from authorities when necessary; InterMovie must also consider the potential impact of the 2006 Terrorism Act. The Terrorism act imposes requirements on service providers to retain certain types of user data for a specified period to assist with terrorism investigations (if that particular user is involved in ongoing terrorist investigations), as well as ensuring no terrorism promoting material is on the site. InterMovie must have measures in place to comply with these requirements while also ensuring user privacy is protected, or they could risk having severe legal action levied against them.  

InterMovie allows users to store movies in a cache on their computer, must ensure that its operations comply with the Computer Misuse Act 1990. This law prohibits unauthorized access and modification of computer systems, which includes InterMovie's servers and user computers. The company must implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to its systems, and it must ensure that its employees and users do not engage in any unauthorized activities. It must also ensure that it’s users are aware that InterMovie is storing media on their computers and is then using their computers to stream that media over the internet to other users taking up the bandwidth provided to the user by their internet service provider (ISP), failure to notify their users of this would mean that InterMovie is violating the Computer Misuse Act. If InterMovie fails to comply with the Computer Misuse Act, it could face legal consequences and loss of user trust. Therefore, InterMovie must take necessary steps to ensure that its operations are in line with the law, which will help to maintain user trust and avoid any legal action.  

Overall, InterMovie must comply with various laws and regulations to ensure it operates within the bounds of the law and adequately respects user privacy. Compliance with copyright law, data protection regulations, and user privacy concerns is crucial to avoid legal action and maintain user trust, which will allow for the company to grow and prosper in the future. Additionally, the company must ensure they consider the potential impact of laws such as the 2006 Terrorism Act, RIPA and IPA and have measures in place to comply with these requirements while respecting user privacy.
