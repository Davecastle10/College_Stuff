This is where the Computer Science A-level work I'm doing whilst at college will be.

I hope you find this usefull to look through and maybe even somewhat enjoyable to do so.


I just finished my last computer science exam at 3:30pm on 18/06/2024, so theoretically ther should be no more major changes to this repo unless i scan in the rest of my physical notes - which might be a good idea actually.

And I will update thsi fie with the grade I got at the end of this journey (Assuming I remember to do so).
