# Aray Tasks
this is a folder with work done playing around with arrays and lists in python

arrays are a list that is composed of only one data type and you must declare its length upon its creation
arrays are more effuicint to search though fro for entrys than lists.
arrays must be contiguously indexed, meaning that the list is in one large data block in RAM with nothing seprrating the array into sections.
