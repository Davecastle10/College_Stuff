# This is a bas dummary of what we did during the lesson thursday 2nd febuary 2023
## re-write this nicely at a later date.
  
yesterdat we did binary addition and subtraction and stuff with sign magnitude and 2s complement stuff do display negativs in binary
sign magnitude in 8 bits has the arrangemnet "- 64 32 16 8 4 2 1" which meANS YOU CAN HVAE NUMBERS BETWEEN -172 and 127 but you can also have negativezero which is BaseAudioContext
2s complement has a bit array in 8 bit "-128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1" which means you can have numbers between -128 aqnd 127 and there are no negative 0 which is goo because negative o sucks
whith 2s complement addition and subtraction is the same thing becasue 45 + 45 is the same as 45 + (-45) so it is easy to do and you can mutiply or divide by just addding or subtracting multiple times  
a bit is a binary Digit 
we also did stuff on roman neumerals and said how they are really bad, and how base 12 would be really good 
we use place value to count and zero is really good

in 2sC you can add as manyy 1's at the start of a number to increase the number of bits without changing the value of the number.
