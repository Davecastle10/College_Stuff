    - You can pick up with your work from any other compupter with an internet connection if you need to continue working whilst travlelling oer your computer stops workig. If you computer is being weird and the code won't run on your computer its difficult to fix, butr if the VM you are using with CodeSpaces or gitpdo etc isn't working, you can just kill ot and open the code up on a new VM

    - TLDR: Easier, can do froma anywhere with a browser, VM's easy to kill when things go wrong, collaborate on config-heavy projects much much easier beavuse evryone can expect the VM's to behave the same whereas local PC's might not.
