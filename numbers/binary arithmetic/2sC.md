# This is abouot 2sC
2s complement has a bit array in 8 bit  
"-128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1"  
which means you can have numbers between -128 and 127 and there are no negative 0 which is good because negative o sucks
whith 2s complement addition and subtraction is the same thing because doing 45 + 45 is the same as doing 45 + (-45) (in practice doing the arithmetic, you don't actually get the same answer) so it is easy to do and you can mutiply or divide by just addding or subtracting multiple times
