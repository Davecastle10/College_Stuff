# Bitwise manipulation
## This has some basic explanantions on how to do bitwise manipulation to times or divid in binary.
112 in binary is 01110000  
56 in binary is  00111000  
  
you can do fnacy maths to work out 56 or you can know that 56 = 112/2  
so you can just shift 112 right one space which is the same as dividing by 2  
this is called a bitwise shift  
in binary it is easy to multiply or divide by any number which is a power of 2  
e.g x 8 means you move 3 bits left  
or to divide by 2 you move 1 bit to the right


## Bitwise AND
if both bits are 1 the bit out is1 but if onlu one bit is 1 the output biy is 0  
01101010  
11111001
--------
01101000  
this was a verry basic explanation, so try some more of this.
